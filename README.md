Small set of scripts I use to send myself daily/weekly/monthly digests of the top hacker news articles.

- gen_mail.py -> generates mail based on a certain criteria
- hackerdump.py -> A script which dumps a json version of hacker news frontpage to a file on disk.
- pyhackerstories.py -> Script from catonmat which does the actual scraping. Thanks :)
- send_mail.py -> script which sends stdin using gmail smtp server.
